## How this works?</br>
Predicting crypto prices, stock prices, weather etc are all examlpes of time series forecasting. The idea is the future prediction depends on past information. RNN's and LSTM's have proved to be state of the art for these kinds of predictions. Due to this property i.e predicting on basis of previous context have made them favourite candidates for tasks like machine translation and language modelling. In fact Google Translate works on a much advanced and complex model of LSTM!
## What is LSTM?</br>
LSTM's are sophisticated RNN units.
